Hi All,

I am using a modified version of ffmpeg muxing.c, my source code is here: http://www.oifii.org/ns-org/nsd/ar/cp/audio_spi/spiffmpegmuxingspectrum_qt2016/spiffmpegmuxingspectrum_qt2016.c

I am loading audio from libsndfile and am generating some background with audio signal draw on top of it.

Now, my question is how to preserve my 44100 audio samplerate quality in this modified muxing.c sample, or maybe go down to 22050, because the sound currently distortions with the current settings?
